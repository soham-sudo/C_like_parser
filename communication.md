Component Communication Architecture
Stream-Based Lexical Analysis
1. Token Stream Generation
Instead of having the parser call getNextToken() each time it needs a token, your lexical analyzer can process the entire input file upfront

Parser to Symbol Table

Pass symbol information when declarations are processed
Query the symbol table during semantic analysis
Check variable existence, types, and scopes

Lexical Analyzer to Symbol Table

When identifiers are recognized, check if they exist
Add literals to a constant pool if needed

All Components to Error Handler

Define a centralized error reporting mechanism
Pass error context (location, severity, message)

2. Implementation Approaches
Option 1: Direct References

Pass component pointers to each other during initialization
Example: parser.setLexer(&lexer); parser.setSymbolTable(&symbolTable);
Pros: Simple, direct method calls
Cons: Tight coupling between components

4. Error Communication
Centralized Error Handler

Define error severity levels (warning, error, fatal)
Create error codes for different types of errors
Track error locations (file, line, column)
Implement recovery strategies

5. Data Flow Examples

Token Processing Flow

    Lexer identifies token "x" at line 10
    Lexer checks with symbol table if "x" exists
    Parser requests token from lexer
    Parser processes token and updates symbol table if needed
    If errors occur, error handler is notified

Error Processing Flow

    Lexer finds invalid character
    Lexer calls errorHandler->report()
    Error handler logs error and decides on continuation
    Lexer attempts recovery by skipping to next valid token
    Parser is notified of recovery action

This communication architecture ensures that each component can access the information it needs while maintaining reasonable separation of concerns. The specific implementation details can be adapted to your programming style and the complexity requirements of your project.
