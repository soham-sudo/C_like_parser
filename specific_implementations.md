Lexical Analyzer Implementation

CStream-Based Lexical Analysis
1. Token Stream Generation
Instead of having the parser call getNextToken() each time it needs a token, your lexical analyzer can process the entire input file upfront:

Token Recognition

Create a Token class/struct with type, value, position
Implement methods to identify keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.
Handle whitespace and comments appropriately


Error Handling

Implement error recovery for invalid tokens
Report descriptive error messages



Symbol Table Implementation

Data Structure

Implement using a hash table
Each entry should contain name, type, value, scope information


Operations

insert(name, attributes): Add a new symbol
lookup(name): Find symbol information
enterScope() and exitScope(): Manage nested scopes



Top-Down Parser Implementation

First and Follow Sets

Implement algorithms to compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets
Store results in maps or sets for quick lookup


Parse Table Construction

Create a 2D table indexed by non-terminals and terminals
Populate based on FIRST/FOLLOW sets
Include error recovery entries


Parser Implementation

Use recursive descent or table-driven approach
Manage the parse stack (for table-driven)
Include synchronization points for error recovery
